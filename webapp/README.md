# BaldShop

A full-stack e-commerce demo app built with Next.js 13 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. Features user authentication, product listing, product details with calculator, and a shopping cartâ€”all with a modern UI.

## Features
- User registration and login (with password hashing)
- Product listing with search and filters
- Product detail page with live calculator (quantity, discount, tax)
- Shopping cart (add, update, remove items)
- MongoDB backend for users, products, and (optionally) cart
- Responsive, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
